Excellent question. This is a critical part of any real-world build system.

The answer is **yes, Taskfiles can handle secrets, but with one absolute rule: Never store secrets directly in the Taskfile or any other file that gets committed to Git.**

The correct and secure way to handle this is to pass the secret to your task via an **environment variable**. Your Taskfile will read the environment variable, but it won't know or care where the value came from. This keeps the secret itself completely separate from your project's code.

Let's add a `push:nuget` task to your system that securely uses a NuGet API key.

### 1. The Plan

1.  **Create a `push:nuget` Task**: This new task in your root `Taskfile.yml` will depend on `pack:nuget` and will call a new `push-nuget` task in the `dotnet` submodule.
2.  **Define a `.env` File**: We'll create a new, separate file for secrets. This file **must be git-ignored**.
3.  **Update the Root `Taskfile.yml`**: We will tell it to load our new secrets file.
4.  **Update the `dotnet` Submodule**: The new `push-nuget` task will use the `NUGET_API_KEY` variable.

---

### 1. Create a `.env.example` and Update `.gitignore`

First, let's create a template for our secrets file.

**File: `.env.example`**

```ini
# This file contains secrets for the build system.
# Copy it to .env and fill in the values.
# IMPORTANT: .env is ignored by git and should NEVER be committed.

NUGET_API_KEY="your_nuget_api_key_here"
NUGET_SOURCE_URL="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json"
```

Now, add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file. This is the most important step.

**File: `.gitignore`**

```
# ... other ignores
.env
.env
```

### 2. Update the `init.ps1` Script

Let's add the new secrets template to our init script.

**File: `.build/init.ps1` (Updated)**

```powershell
# ... (top part of the script is the same)
$SourceEnvExample = Join-Path -Path $ScriptDir -ChildPath "templates/.env.example.template"
$SourceSecretExample = Join-Path -Path $ScriptDir -ChildPath "templates/.env.example.template" # <-- New

$DestEnvExample = Join-Path -Path $RepoRoot -ChildPath ".env.example"
$DestSecretExample = Join-Path -Path $RepoRoot -ChildPath ".env.example" # <-- New

# ... (Copy-TemplateFile and Copy-TemplateDirectory functions are the same)

# --- Execute the copy operations ---
# ... (existing copy operations)
Copy-TemplateFile -SourcePath $SourceSecretExample -DestinationPath $DestSecretExample -ShouldForce $Force # <-- New

# --- Provide next steps ---
# ... (update next steps)
Write-Host "   Next steps:"
Write-Host "   1. Run 'task setup' to restore local tools."
Write-Host "   2. Copy '.env.example' to '.env' and customize it."
Write-Host "   3. Copy '.env.example' to '.env' and add your API keys."
# ...
```

*(You'll need to create the `.build/templates/.env.example.template` file for this to work).*

### 3. Update the `dotnet` Submodule Taskfile

Let's add the actual `push-nuget` task.

**File: `.build/dotnet/Taskfile.yml` (Updated)**

```yaml
# ... (existing tasks are unchanged)

  push-nuget:
    desc: "Pushes the NuGet package to a feed"
    # This task requires these variables to be set in the environment
    vars:
      NUGET_PACKAGE_PATH: '{{.NUGET_OUTPUT_DIR}}/{{.PROJECT_TO_PACK | replace "csproj" "nupkg" | replace "/" "."}}'
      NUGET_API_KEY: "{{.NUGET_API_KEY}}"
      NUGET_SOURCE_URL: "{{.NUGET_SOURCE_URL}}"
    cmds:
      - >
        dotnet nuget push "{{.NUGET_PACKAGE_PATH}}"
        -k {{.NUGET_API_KEY}}
        -s {{.NUGET_SOURCE_URL}}
        --skip-duplicate
```

*Note: The `NUGET_PACKAGE_PATH` logic is a bit of a guess at the package name format. You may need to adjust it if your project/package naming is different.*

### 4. Update the Root `Taskfile.yml`

Finally, let's orchestrate the new push task and tell Task to load the secrets file.

**File: `Taskfile.yml` (Updated)**

```yaml
# https://taskfile.dev
version: "3"

# Tell Task to load variables from both .env and .env if they exist.
dotenv: [".env", ".env"]

# ... (vars and includes are unchanged)

tasks:
  # ... (default, clean, build, test, setup, get-version are unchanged)
  # ... (publish-app, pack:nuget, pack:velopack are unchanged)

  push:nuget:
    desc: "Packs and pushes the library to a NuGet feed"
    deps: [pack:nuget]
    preconditions:
      # Precondition to ensure the API key is set
      - sh: '[ -n "$NUGET_API_KEY" ]'
        msg: "NUGET_API_KEY is not set. Please add it to .env."
    cmds:
      - task: dotnet:push-nuget
```

### How It All Works

1.  **Local Development**:
    *   You run `init.ps1`.
    *   You copy `.env.example` to `.env` and paste your real NuGet API key into it.
    *   You run `task push:nuget`.
    *   Task reads your `Taskfile.yml` and sees `dotenv: [".env", ".env"]`. It loads all variables from both files.
    *   The `push:nuget` task runs, checks that `NUGET_API_KEY` exists, and then calls the submodule task, which uses the secret key in the `dotnet nuget push` command.
    *   Your `.env` file is safely on your local machine, ignored by Git.

2.  **CI/CD (e.g., GitHub Actions)**:
    *   You store your NuGet API key as a "Repository Secret" in GitHub settings.
    *   In your workflow YAML, you pass this secret to the task as an environment variable.

    ```yaml
    - name: Push NuGet Package
      env:
        NUGET_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.NUGET_API_KEY }}
      run: task push:nuget
    ```
    *   The `task push:nuget` command runs, and Task automatically sees that `NUGET_API_KEY` is already in the environment. It uses it just as if it came from the `.env` file.

This is the standard, secure, and flexible way to manage secrets for automation.
